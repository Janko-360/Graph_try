# Graph_try
Exercise in creating custom graphs with NetworkX  
NO AI assistance, just documentation and stack overflow searching!  
<br>
Creating random weighted graphs and visualizing them. Then automatically calculating the shortest route between two nodes with the default Dijkstra's algorithm.  
All in the slight theme of a road network connecting town nodes.
